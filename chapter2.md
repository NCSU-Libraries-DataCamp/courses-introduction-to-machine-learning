## Get to Know Your Data

In this exercise, you will test whether there is a connection between a person's salary and their happiness level. The first step is to get to know the data we'll be using.

You will work with a small dataset called `emp_data`, which has two columns and 20 observations. The 2 columns are `earnings` (a person's salary per day) and `s_rating` (satisfaction level)

`emp_data` = Employee dataset

`earnings` = What each employee earns in dollars per day

`s_rating` = How satisfied the employee is with his/her wage


*** =instructions

The dataset `emp_data` has already been created for you and loaded into this session. Read the steps in the script.R window and follow the instructions for each step!

## Making a prediction

From the `emp_data` dataset, we will try to predict a new employee's satisfaction rating when he is paid $200, $400, or $1200 per day.

The `earnings` variable is the **predictor**, which means it's the data that we use to make the prediction.

The `s_rating` variable is the **class** variable, or the thing we're trying to predict. 


Let's plot the data we already have to see if there is a relationship between `earnings` and `s_rating`, or an employee satisfaction.

*** =instructions
- Plot `emp_data` with earnings on the x-axis and `s_rating` on the y-axis. Follow the steps in the script.R file.

*** =hint
This exercise requires you to fill in the blanks provided in the plot() function. Set x = earnings and y = s_rating for best results!


*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(caret)
earnings <- c(120, 100, 700, 200, 60, 20, 200, 130, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 210, 220, 400, 550, 670, 695, 300)

s_rating<- c(50, 60, 80, 75, 50, 70, 75, 60, 50, 65, 70, 71,80, 82, 85, 80, 88, 90, 90, 60)

emp_data  <- data.frame(earnings, s_rating)

```

*** =sample_code
```{r}

#1. Make a scatterplot of emp_data with earnings on the x-axis and s_rating on the y_axis.

# The plot function looks like this: `plot(x=____, y=_____,  col=_____, main="_______")` 
# `x` is your independent variable  
# `y` is your dependent variable  
# `col=y` means that the color of the plot is set to the y variable.  
# `main="Regression Modeling" is the title of the plot.

#Fill in the blanks:

plot(x=, y=, col= , main="Regression Modeling")

## The Caret Package

R packages can be very useful because they contain functions that aren't including in the base R code. Importing packages into your R session will allow you to access the functions in those packages. We are going to import a package for machine learning called "caret". 

It is common practice in machine learning to partition dataset for analysis into Training and Test sets in order to test the accuracy of your model before feeding in new data. To do this, we will use a function called `createDataPartition()` from the caret package. 

To learn more about this function, type `?caret::createDataPartition` in the console or the script.R window.

When you are done reading, click Submit Answer.

## Create a Training Set

Both training and test data sets come from the original dataset. A training set is usually 60 - 70% of the entire dataset while the test set is about 30 - 40%.

The createDataPartition() function can be used to split the data. This function is used like so:

Suppose `myData` is the name of a dataset and I want to predict `class`, which is an attribute in the dataset `myData`.  We create a data partition where `y = class`. In this formula, we type the `class` variable as `myData$class`, using a `$` between the name of the data set and the variable name we want. This is standard R notation for referring to a variable in a dataset.
```{r}
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y= myData$class, p=0.7, list=FALSE)

training <- myData[inTrain, ]

test <- myData[-inTrain, ]
```

- We define two variables, `training` and `test`, as inside of inTrain [inTrain,] and outside of inTrain [-inTrain,] respectively.

- `p` is set to `0.7` because we need 70% of the whole data

- list = FALSE because we do not want the function to return `inTrain` as a list.


*** =instructions

- Use createDataPartition() function in R to partition your dataset. This example may help you: `createDataPartition(y= myData$class, p=0.7, list=FALSE)`
- Your training set should be 60% of the entire dataset (p=0.6)
- Print out the training and test sets  
- Check the dimension of both datasets to know more about the data

*** =hint
- type ?createDataPartition and hit Enter in the console to know how to use the createDataPartition() function
- Make p=0.6 and set list=FALSE
- To print a variable to the console, simply type the name of the variable on a new line.
- Use the `dim()` function on training and test set for the fourth instruction

*** =pre_exercise_code

```{r}

# Loading the required package

library(caret)

# Create the dataset

earnings <- c(120, 100, 700, 200, 60, 20, 200, 130, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 210, 220, 400, 550, 670, 695, 300)

s_rating<- c(50, 60, 80, 75, 50, 70, 75, 60, 50, 65, 70, 71,80, 82, 85, 80, 88, 90, 90, 60)

emp_data  <- data.frame(earnings, s_rating)

```

## Create Model

The `lm()` function in R is an implementation of the Linear Regression algorithm. 

You will create a linear model called `reg_model` by plugging in the training set into the `lm()` function.

This model is simply a line. Regression modeling is used to find equations(lines) that fit data.

The equation is of the form:

`y = a + bx + ei`

`y` is what we want to predict and `x` includes all the predictors required to form the model above.

`a` and `b` are **coefficients** determined by the `lm()` function we’ll use shortly. `ei` stands for errors as a result of the factors we did not consider.  

The best model is one that minimizes ei the most. 

A regression model is easy to implement but it often produces low performance models. This method is useful when the variable involved can be modeled in a linear way.

For example, to show that increase in age leads to increase in weight, or an increase in age leads to decrease in the number of hairs on the head. This cannot be used in showing increase in library visitor per day of the week, which is usually non-linear.

`lm()` function is used like this: Suppose `myData` is the name of a dataset and I want to predict `class` an attribute in the dataset `myData` using `sex` (another attribute in myData) as my predictor:

`reg_model <- lm(class, sex, data=myData)`

We can get `a` and `b` from `reg_model` using the coef function:

a <- coef(reg_model)[1]

b <- coef(reg_model)[2]

*** =instructions
- Create a linear model called `reg_model` on the training dataset
- Plot the `training` set with earnings on the x-axis and s_rating on the y-axis
- Draw a regression line on the plot above that represents the model reg_model 
- Print out the coefficients a and b 

*** =hint
- Type `?lm` to learn how to use the lm() function
- Use `abline()` function to fit a line to the plot. Put the model name inside parenthesis.
- type ?coef to know how to use the coef() function

## Test Model

Here, you will create a function called `predict_happiness` to test your model. 

You are to get coefficients `a` and `b` from `reg_model` and predict satisfaction when employee is paid `$200`, `$400`, and `$1200` using `predict_hapiness` function.

predict_happiness <- function(x){
  
  a = 
  
  b =
  
  Result<- a + (b * x) 
 
  percent<- "%"
  
  cat(sprintf("The employee should be %s%s satisfied", Result, percent))
  
  }

*** =instructions
- Complete the predict_happiness function 
- Insert $200, $400 and then $1200
- Instead of using `predict_happiness` function, you can also use the built-in `predict` funtion provided by caret package.The predict function takes in the model and the test dataset like this
`predict(red_model, test)`. Put all your predicted values in a variable called `pred_rating` as in `pred_rating <- predicted(reg_model, test)`
- Compare pred_rating with the s_rating column in the test data. What do you observe? Are the predicted ratings close to the actual?

*** =hint
- Get coefficents `a` and `b` from  `reg_model` using the `coef()` function as in previous exercises.
- Use the data.frame() function to create a table with two variables pred_rating and test$s_rating.

## Check Accuracy

There a number of ways to evaluate your model. For this exercise, you will use the root-mean-square error (RMSE). 
RMSE is gotten by calculating mean squared errors. This is simply a measures of deviation of predicted points from the original value.


The formula is:

  rmse  = ![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_5412/datasets/rmse.png)


Where:

 * f = predicted values 
 * o = true values 
The bar above the squared differences means find the mean of the squared difference.


*** =instructions
- You can find the rmse of the test dataset by running the code below in the console:

    `sqrt(sum((pred_rating - test$s_rating)^2))`
