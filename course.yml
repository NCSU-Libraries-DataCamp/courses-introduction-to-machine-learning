title: Introduction to Machine Learning with R
description: While machine learning has been around awhile, it still remains a mysterious
  black box to many. How does it really work? By the end of the course, you should
  better understand the basics of machine learning and will get hands on experience
  developing linear regression and random forests models. Some prior experience with
  R would be helpful before tackling this course. DataCamp offers a free Introduction
  to R course that would be beneficial to complete prior to starting this course.
